  <p id="first-paragraph">Are you looking for a gaming PC? There's many ways to get one, covering two here, you can let us know what
    you're looking for and we can get the parts and build it for you for a small fee or you can source the parts and
    build it yourself. We carry parts for the self-builders as well.</p>

  <p>Now for the people that are beginners, I think it's a great idea to build your own computer.It's nice knowing the
    ins and outs of your PC and the parts that make it what it is. It can be a daunting task but with the help of the
    internet, there's no doubt that you can get it done. We have a video from <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/@LinusTechTips">Linus Tech Tips</a> that goes really in depth
    on PC parts and building PCs. It is a great resource for beginners and pros alike.</p>
